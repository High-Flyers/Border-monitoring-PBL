# PBL - Mapa i Raport

This repository contains two HTML scripts for creating a "MAPA" and a "RAPORT" webpage.

## MAPA (index.html)

The "MAPA" script creates a webpage with a Leaflet map that displays an interactive map. Here's what it does:

- It includes the Leaflet library to render the map.
- Users can click on the map, and a popup will display the coordinates of the clicked location.
- Two markers, "Wykrycie 1" and "Wykrycie 2," are added to the map with custom icons.

To use this script, open the "index.html" file in your browser. You can customize the map's appearance and add more markers as needed.
You can also navigate between pages by clicking on "MAPA" and "RAPORT" buttons, at page's navbar.

## RAPORT (raport.html)

The "RAPORT" script creates a webpage that displays a report containing images and related information. Here's what it does:

- It includes a navigation menu with a logo.
- The report section is scrollable, and each entry contains an image and associated data.
- Currently, there are two entries with images and information, which you can customize.
- Images are loaded from the "../public" directory, and data can be edited within each `<div class="item">`.

To use this script, open the "raport.html" file in your browser. You can add more entries or customize existing ones to create a report with your content.

Feel free to modify and enhance these scripts to suit your specific needs and design preferences.
